# Delicious Chocolate Cake Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 3/4 cups granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tbsp instant coffee (optional, for mocha flavor)
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup whole milk
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil (or melted butter)
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup boiling water
- 1 handful of chocolate chunks or chips (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. Stir in the instant coffee for a hint of mocha flavor.
4. Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla. Mix until smooth.
5. Carefully stir in the boiling water — the batter will be thin, that’s okay.
6. Fold in the chocolate chunks for extra indulgence.
7. Line the bottom of the baking pan with parchment paper and pour in the batter.
8. Bake for 30–35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
9. Let the cake cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
10. Frost with your favorite chocolate frosting or dust with powdered sugar before serving.
